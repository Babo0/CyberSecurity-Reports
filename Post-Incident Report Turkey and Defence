Host Name: Danger-Win-PC


Post-Incident Report

Identified network traffic and potential file download by using the http filter in Wireshark.
The user was also viewing other sources while this file was downloaded


By using "ip.addr == 46.29.160.132" as a filter from the Snort logs, I concluded that while looking in the traffic finding file downloads from that IP address might lead to finding the malicious activity.


Verifying a file was downloaded from the IP Address via alert, a file titled "ngul5.xap" has a high potential of being the malicious file.
Following the TCP Stream revealed the comment "This program cannot be run in DOS mode."


With the DOS header being an indication of a potential malicious item, the following was done:
Using Wireshark to download HTTP objects, found the "ngul5.xap"


Post-Incident Report

Upon saving the "*.xap" file the SHA256 sum needed to be verified to make sure that the download was actually malicious

After inputting the SHA256 Sum into Virustotal the following was confirmed:

Virustotal came back with the results of 57/70 AV companies came back as this being malicious.
Under the comments section it came back as Ursnif
